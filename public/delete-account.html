    <h1>ParkU – Delete your account</h1>
    <p>This page is provided by <strong>ParkU</strong> (the app and developer name shown on the Google Play store listing) so you can request that your account and associated data are deleted.</p>

    <h2>Steps to request account and data deletion</h2>
    <div class="steps">
      <ol>
        <li>Open the <strong>ParkU</strong> app on your device.</li>
        <li>Sign in to your account if you are not already signed in.</li>
        <li>Go to the <strong>Profile</strong> tab (bottom navigation).</li>
        <li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Delete account</strong>.</li>
        <li>Read the confirmation message and tap <strong>Delete my account</strong> to permanently delete your account and associated data.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>After you confirm, your account and the data described below will be permanently deleted. You will be signed out and will need to create a new account if you want to use ParkU again.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Data we delete and data we keep</h2>
    <div class="data-section">
      <p><strong>Deleted when you delete your account:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your ParkU account (profile, name, email, phone number)</li>
        <li>Your saved parking spots and parking history linked to your profile</li>
        <li>Your Firebase Authentication record (you will no longer be able to sign in with that account)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Retained (for legal, tax, or fraud prevention):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Anonymized or aggregated transaction and reservation records may be retained as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (e.g. tax, dispute resolution). Such data does not identify you personally.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Retention period:</strong> Where we retain anonymized or aggregated data, we do so only for as long as necessary for the stated purposes (typically no longer than required by applicable law, e.g. up to 7 years for tax in some jurisdictions).</p>
    </div>

    <p class="note">If you cannot open the app or need help, contact support and mention that you want to delete your ParkU account and data. We will process your request in line with this policy.</p>
